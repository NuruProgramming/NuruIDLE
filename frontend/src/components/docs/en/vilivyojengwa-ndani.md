# Built-in Functions in Nuru

Nuru has several built-in functions that perform specific tasks.

## The andika() Function

The `andika()` function is used to print out messages to the console. It can take zero or more arguments, and the arguments will be printed out with a space in between them. Additionally, `andika()` supports basic formatting such as /n for a new line, /t for a tab space, and \\ for a backslash. Here's an example:

```go
andika(1, 2, 3) // Output: "1 2 3"
```

## The jaza() Function

The `jaza()` function is used to get input from the user. It can take zero or one argument, which is a string that will be used as a prompt for the user. Here's an example:

```go
fanya salamu = unda() {
    fanya jina = jaza("Unaitwa nani? ")
    andika("Mambo vipi", jina)
}

salamu()
```

In this example, we define a function `salamu()` that prompts the user to enter their name using the `jaza()` function. We then use the `andika()` function to print out a message that includes the user's name.

## The aina() Function

The `aina()` function is used to determine the type of an object. It accepts one argument, and the return value will be a string indicating the type of the object. Here's an example:

```go
aina(2) // Output: "NAMBA"
aina("Nuru") // Output: "NENO"
```

## The fungua() Function

The `fungua()` function is used to open a file. It accepts one argument, which is the path to the file that you want to open. Here's an example:

```go
faili = fungua("data.txt")
```

In this example, we use the `fungua()` function to open a file named "data.txt". The variable faili will contain a reference to the opened file.
